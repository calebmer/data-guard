# Data Guard

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/calebmer/data-guard.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
I was frustrated with all the validation libraries out there. They all are hard to write custom error messages for, most of them are schema-less, they are not interoperable between frameworks, they did not do asynchronous validation, and many many more grievances. So I made my own validation library `data-guard`. If it does not work well for your use-case **submit an issue**. Let's work together to design a simple, extendable validation library.

## Documentationâ€”WIP
If you want to learn more about `data-guard`, bug me about it on the issue tracker and I can write some documentation.
